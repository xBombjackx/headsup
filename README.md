The short answer is that I was trying to figure out if you could replace the Streamelements Chat Box widget with something that does the exact same thing but also has TikTok chat in it.  The answer is that you kind of can, but it's annoying.

TikTok doesn't really want you to do it and the technique is reverse engineered and always subject to be broken by a TikTok update.  Some other things I didn't figure out yet are "how to easily get all these oauths/secrets/api keys in a way that's not obnoxious for a user."
